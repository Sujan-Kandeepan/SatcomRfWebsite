# Satcom RF Website

This repository contains a full copy of the source code (with commit history)
of the **Satcom RF Website** project, the original project and working
application belonging to **Communications & Power Industries - Satcom**.
Credits go to *Wojtek Mastej* for authoring an early-stage version of the
project 4 years prior which was then updated by *Walter Wong*, before I had
taken over and completed the project during my Summer 2018 co-op term under the
guidance of Wojtek.

The database which this project relies on **remains private to CPI**, meaning
that this project cannot be run externally. However, the source code is
available here as it does not contain any compromised information. Running on
CPI's internal server, this is a large-scale web application allowing CPI
Satcom employees to view, modify or download information about test results,
specifications, calculated statistics and more, along with an overhauled system
for managing device calibration information which I've designed and implemented
from the ground up.

Here is an overview of the Entity Framework database model used:
